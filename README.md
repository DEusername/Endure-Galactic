# Endure-Galactic

## Description

Endure Galactic is a 2D, top-down, bullet-hell, arcade space survival game where you strafe and evade enemies' attacks while striking when openings arise. Take on the role of a traitorous commander sentenced to death via drifting endlessly in space. After gaining both a ship and partner, survive endless waves to reach higher rounds and scrap amounts.

This repository's purpose is for showing off the code I developed for the game. It does not entail all of the code I used, as I used some scripts from Brett Gregory's [2D Space Kit](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/2d-space-kit-27662?srsltid=AfmBOopLmxYvHiOMnIaqKUT-JiAXedg5pwNM87MnxZBN_fPFn96dMReq). 

All code in this repository is my own work, and was used for the game Endure Galactic.

You can find the Itch.io page with the game's downloadable here:

I made this game a while back, but never got around to publishing it until now. This is the first game I've made, and I had very little idea of what I was really doing. I hope you enjoy playing it.

## Directory Guide

### Scripts Entails: 
The Scripts directory houses all of the scripts that I built and incorporated for this video game. Inside there are various folders for the different types of scripts I made alongside more general scripts.
- **NOTE:** There are .meta files for each .cs file in the repo, and each folder in the Scripts directory. These should be left alone and in their current places, as they are necessary for Unity to track asset references, GUIDs, and import settings. They are essential for Unity to correctly recognize and link assets when opening the project.
